/**
 * @brief Transforms an array into a zigzag sequence.
 *
 * Given an array of distinct integers, this function transforms the array into a zigzag sequence
 * by permuting the array elements. A sequence is called a zigzag sequence if the first half of 
 * the elements in the sequence are in increasing order and the last half of the elements are in 
 * decreasing order. The function finds the lexicographically smallest zigzag sequence of the 
 * given array.
 *
 * @param a The input array of distinct integers.
 * @param n The length of the array (n is always odd).
 * @return A vector containing the lexicographically smallest zigzag sequence.
